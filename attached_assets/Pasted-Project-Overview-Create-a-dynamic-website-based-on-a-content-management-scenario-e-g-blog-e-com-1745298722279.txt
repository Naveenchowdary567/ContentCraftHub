Project Overview:
Create a dynamic website based on a content management scenario (e.g., blog, e-commerce, portfolio site). The website should consist of both frontend and backend components. Use the Node.js backend with Express for server-side logic and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development. The website should be deployed on Replit.

Frontend Files:
1. HTML (index.html):
Structure the webpage, ensuring to include:

A homepage that dynamically lists content (e.g., blog posts or products).

Forms to create and update content.

Buttons to delete content.

A responsive navigation bar with links to various sections.

User-friendly UI with clear call-to-actions (e.g., login, register, create post, etc.).

2. CSS (styles.css):
Apply styling for:

General page layout (header, main content, footer).

Responsive design using media queries to make the site mobile-friendly.

Form styling to make it visually appealing and easy to use.

Buttons and links that are interactive and user-friendly.

Ensure the layout is clean and professional using CSS Grid or Flexbox for layouts.

3. JavaScript (scripts.js):
Handle frontend interactivity such as:

Form validation (checking if all fields are filled before submission).

Dynamic content loading (using JavaScript to fetch data from the backend and display it).

Delete and update content on the page without reloading (AJAX/fetch API).

Show feedback after user actions (e.g., success message after posting, or error handling).

Backend Files:
1. Node.js (app.js):
Server Setup:

Initialize a basic Express.js app.

Use body-parser for parsing incoming requests (e.g., form submissions).

Set up routes to handle:

GET requests to retrieve data (e.g., /posts).

POST requests to create new data (e.g., /create).

PUT requests to update data (e.g., /update/:id).

DELETE requests to remove data (e.g., /delete/:id).

Use EJS (or another templating engine like Pug) to render dynamic content on the frontend if needed.

2. Database (JSON File or MongoDB):
Use a JSON file (or MongoDB for larger scale applications) to store content, such as:

Blog posts, user profiles, or product data.

Each item should have a title, content, and other necessary fields (e.g., for products: name, description, price).

For MongoDB:

Set up MongoDB Atlas (for cloud storage) or a local MongoDB instance.

Install necessary packages (mongoose for MongoDB integration).

3. API Routes:
GET /posts: Retrieve all content from the database.

POST /create: Handle form submission for creating new posts/products.

PUT /update/:id: Update an existing post/product by ID.

DELETE /delete/:id: Delete a post/product by ID.

Testing and Deployment Files:
1. Test Cases (optional):
Set up unit tests for routes and database logic (using Mocha or Jest).

Test CRUD operations to ensure data is properly created, updated, and deleted.

Test form validation and error handling.

2. Deployment on Replit:
Use Replitâ€™s deployment feature to make the website publicly accessible.

Ensure the backend API is hosted and accessible by the frontend.

3. README.md:
Write a brief README to explain:

The purpose of the website.

Technologies used (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

Instructions for setting up and running the project locally or on Replit.

URL of the deployed website.
